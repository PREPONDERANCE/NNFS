# Neural Network From Scratch

## Introduction

This repo records my learning process through the book "Neural Network
From Scratch in Python", a fantastic work for starters. For this purpose,
I've also written down core understandings for some of the chapters and
hosted them on [GitHub Pages](https://preponderance.github.io/Neural-Network/).

## Code Structure

There're two main folders in the code base: Docs and Learning, respectively
holding the understanding of each chapter and code example in each chapter.
