# Getting Started

This site will record my learning progress through the book **[Neural Network from Scratch in Python](https://github.com/Dev-Gaju/NNFS-book-with-Implementation/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20from%20Scratch%20in%20Python.pdf)**.

## Content

This documentation will unfold itself following the book content in which I shall explain some of the difficult part to understand or some extended knowledge.
